# Elderly Helper

Elderly Helper is a smart device project designed to enhance the safety of elderly individuals by monitoring caregiver behavior and enabling emergency alerts through AI and IoT technologies.

## Project Overview
This project addresses the issue of elder abuse and neglect by proposing a discreet, technology-assisted monitoring system. The device focuses on protecting elderly users while preserving their dignity and privacy, allowing family members to receive alerts only when abnormal or harmful situations are detected.

The project integrates user research, market analysis, and technical system design to explore how intelligent devices can support safer caregiving environments.

## Key Features
- Voice recognition–based monitoring for abnormal interactions  
- Real-time alert system for emergency situations  
- Privacy-focused and discreet physical design  
- Raspberry Pi–based hardware prototype  
- Simple user interface suitable for elderly users  

## Research and Design Process
The project includes:
- Background research on elder abuse and caregiving challenges  
- User interviews and persona development  
- Market research and competitive analysis  
- System concept design and technical workflow planning  
- Physical prototype design and implementation  

## Technical Concept
The proposed system leverages:
- Speech recognition and similarity matching to detect abnormal behavior  
- AI-assisted decision logic for triggering alerts  
- IoT connectivity for real-time notifications  
- Embedded hardware using Raspberry Pi  

This repository focuses on the **conceptual design, system architecture, and project outcomes**, rather than full software implementation.

## Project Output
- **Elderly Helper Project Report (PDF)**  
  A complete documentation of the research, design process, system concept, and final prototype.

## Notes
This repository serves as a project showcase. Source code is not included, as the emphasis of the project is on design thinking, system modeling, and applied AI concepts.
